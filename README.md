Data Analysis Internship Project - Excelerate (September 2025)
📝 Project Introduction

This repository showcases my Data Analyst Internship Project at Excelerate (Sept 2025), where I worked on real-world datasets, performed data cleaning and analysis, built interactive dashboards, and validated data quality to support business decisions.

The project spans over 3 weeks, with each week focusing on a specific aspect of data analysis and organized into separate folders containing reports, datasets, and code.

Week 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Database Setup

🎯 Objective: Clean raw data from Applicants, Campaigns, and Outreach sources, extract insights, and prepare a foundation (database) for further analysis.

📋 Key Tasks:

Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, null values, and formatting errors from three datasets (ApplicantData, CampaignData, OutreachData).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns and relationships.

Database Management: Designed a schema in PostgreSQL to combine cleaned datasets into a MasterTable, setting appropriate primary and foreign keys.

📦 Deliverables:

EDA_REPORT.pdf: Detailed report of the cleaning process and findings.

Cleaned Datasets: Ready-to-use datasets for further analysis.

Week 2: Building an Interactive Dashboard in Looker Studio

🎯 Objective: Create a dynamic and interactive dashboard to visualize call center data and track key performance indicators (KPIs).

📋 Key Tasks:

KPI Identification: Defined metrics such as Connectivity Rate, Total Connected/Disconnected Calls, and agent performance.

Dashboard Design: Built a user-friendly dashboard in Looker Studio featuring line charts, bar charts, and scorecards.

Data Storytelling: Structured the dashboard to narrate performance — from overall trends to agent-level insights.

Filtering: Added interactive filters for Agent, Country, and Date for easier data exploration.

📦 Deliverables:

Connectivity_Rate_Analysis_Dashboard.pdf: Visual overview of the final dashboard.

Final_Dashboard_Report.pdf: Detailed report explaining design choices and insights.

Week 3: Data Validation of Shipping Dataset

🎯 Objective: Assess the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of a shipping dataset to ensure data-driven decision-making.

📋 Key Tasks:

SQL Queries for Validation: Wrote SQL scripts to identify:

Duplicate shipping_id records.

Missing status or customer values.

Invalid entries (e.g., status 5 or negative customer IDs).

Reporting: Documented issues found and provided recommendations for resolution through reports and presentations.

📦 Deliverables:

Week3_Validation.sql: SQL scripts used for validation.

Week3_Summary_Report.pdf: Summary of issues and recommendations.

Week3_Presentation.pptx: Presentation of findings.
